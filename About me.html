<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m a Full Stack Web Developer with a strong passion for building scalable web applications and engaging user experiences. I specialize in both front-end and back-end development, bringing ideas to life from concept to production.

With experience in technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and SQL, I enjoy working across the full development cycle — from UI/UX design and responsive layouts to server-side logic and database management.

I’m always curious about learning new technologies, optimizing performance, and solving complex problems with clean, maintainable code. Whether it's a startup project, a business website, or a full-fledged application, I bring creativity, collaboration, and commitment to every line of code I write.

Outside of coding, I enjoy contributing to open-source, exploring new design trends, and continuously growing as a developer.</p>
